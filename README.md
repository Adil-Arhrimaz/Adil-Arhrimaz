I am a passionate GIS Engineer/Developer with extensive experience in front-end development using Angular and React, and back-end development with .NET. I specialize in creating innovative GIS scripts in Python and have worked with tools like Leaflet, OpenLayers, QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, GeoServer, and ArcGIS Server. I'm skilled in handling both relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and non-relational databases like MongoDB.

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
I am currently engaged in an exciting project named 'Treevans'. This innovative project focuses on managing trees and assisting in decision-making processes related to their care and maintenance. At the core of 'Treevans' is a commitment to environmental sustainability and effective urban planning. My role involves developing robust GIS solutions and integrating spatial data to create a comprehensive system for tree management. This project not only leverages my GIS expertise but also allows me to contribute positively to environmental conservation efforts.
